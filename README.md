# Statamic - Starter kit

The Statamic cms template makes it super easy to start a new project with a bunge of pre-defined settings. These settings are quite various and consist of fieldsets & blueprints, statamic settings, addons and many more.

## How to install

1. `statamic new {project_name} maartenvanhunsel/statamic-starter-kit`
2. Make sure `laravel/telescope` is configured correctly and update your `composer.json` file with the following:
```json
"extra": {
  "laravel": {
    "dont-discover": [
      "laravel/telescope"
    ]
  }
},
```
3. Add submodule [by instructions](https://gitlab.com/ptchr-projects/statamic-basics).
4. `cp .env.example .env`
5. `php artisan key:generate`
6. `yarn install && yarn build`
7. `valet link {project_name}`
8. Navigate to `http://{project_name}/cp`
9. Update `README.md` and update placeholders with correct values.
```bash
cp README-template.md README.md
# Replace [PROJECT_NAME] and [PROJECT_SSH_URL] with the correct values.
rm README-template.md
```
10. Et voil√†.
